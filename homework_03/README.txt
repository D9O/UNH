Professor-

Programs D and E are very long.  I got stuck on trying to figure out a way to do nested bool searches, e.g.:
  (((young OR men) AND love) OR stars) 

From what I can tell, what I came up with works.  I commented the code to try and explain it all.  I got help from:
http://mathcenter.oxford.emory.edu/site/cs171/shuntingYardAlgorithm/
though I don't know that it's readily apparent in the final product. 

I won't go so over-the-top on all assignments, but in this masters program, you get out what you put in.

I've already gained a deeper understanding for Python (which I love, BTW), and am really enjoying class.

Sincerely,

Andy

ps- I'm trying not to be an annoying know-it-all in class.  But sometimes I just have to answer the questions you ask.
